Yet another Python web microframework. This one boasts simplicity, minimalism, transparency, and integration with the latest HTML5 stuff, such as web sockets. Also, sessions, because who doesn't like sessions?

A little to-do list for myself:

- Request and Response decorators!
- Request parser (forms, etc)
- Content parser (iterables, generators?)
- Static files (304, etc)
- Websockets
- Cookies (response?)
- Sessions
