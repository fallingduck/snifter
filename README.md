Yet another Python web microframework. This one boasts simplicity, minimalism, transparency, and integration with the latest HTML5 stuff, such as web sockets. Also, sessions, because who doesn't like sessions?

A little to-do list for myself:

- Cookies (request, response)
- Static files (304, etc)
- Websockets
- Sessions
